# ZEROCRUMB
Have you ever wondered how many calories you are consuming every day? It is an extremely useful tool, but gets overwhelming when one has to manually input the calories. Also, we do not certainly know the exact or approximate calories of a 
food. 

ZeroCrumb aims to solve this problem. This is a web app to track daily intake-calories based on pictures uploaded by the user. With assistance of AI, ZeroCrumb analyzes the 
uploaded picture and outputs an approximate calories content, as well as how many 
calories left the user has for the day.
